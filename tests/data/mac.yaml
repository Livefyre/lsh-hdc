model:
  kmin: 4  # number of minima (k) in minhash
  sig_width: 16  # Length of minhash signature. Must be a multiple of kmin. Should usually also be a multiple of lsh_bandwidth.
  min_support: 1  # Minimum number of matching keys (>=1)

  lsh_options:
    bandwidth: 3  # Rows per LSH band. Setting this to 1 effectively turns off LSH (do not try this in production...)
    scheme: "b2"  # LSH banding scheme. Use a0 for non-overlapping bands, a1 for circularly overlapping, ax (where x is bandwidth)
  shingler:
    span: 3       # Length of shingles (in words)
    skip: 0       # How many words to skip
    unique: true  # Discard duplicates
  sketch:
    enabled: true
    algorithm: "simhash"  # [simhash, minhash]
    size: 2  # Length of sketch vector, in bytes
    resemblance: 0.75  # Minimum Hamming similarity of bit vectors (set to zero to remove this constraint)
    shingler:
      span: 3       # Length of shingles (in words)
      skip: 1       # How many words to skip
      unique: true  # Discard duplicates
