model:
  kmin: 3  # number of minima (k) in minhash
  sig_width: 60  # Length of minhash signature. Must be a multiple of kmin. Should usually also be a multiple of lsh_bandwidth.
  min_support: 1  # Minimum number of matching keys (>=1)

  lsh_options:
    bandwidth: 3  # Rows per LSH band. Setting this to 1 effectively turns off LSH (do not try this in production...)
    scheme: "a0"  # LSH banding scheme. Use a0 for non-overlapping bands, a1 for circularly overlapping, ax (where x is bandwidth)
  shingler:
